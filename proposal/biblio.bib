abstract="This paper presents the Vampir tool-set for performance analysis of parallel applications. It consists of the run-time measurement system VampirTrace and the visualization tools Vampir and VampirServer. It describes the major features and outlines the underlying implementation that is necessary to provide low overhead and good scalability. Furthermore, it gives a short overview about the development history and future work as well as related work.",
